Vulnerability Description:
Host header injection is a vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can manipulate the Host header of an HTTP request. The Host header is used to specify the target host or domain of the request. When an application does not properly validate or sanitize the Host header, it can lead to various security risks.

Threats:
Host header injection introduces several threats:
1. Cache Poisoning: Attackers can inject malicious content into caches or proxy servers by manipulating the Host header.
2. Server Impersonation: Attackers can trick the server into believing it is receiving requests for a different domain, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data leakage.
3. Session Hijacking: By injecting a malicious Host header, attackers can manipulate session cookies and hijack user sessions.
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Host header injection can be used as part of an XSS attack, where the attacker injects malicious scripts into the response.

Attacker Exploitation:
Attackers can exploit host header injection by:
1. Impersonating Other Domains: By manipulating the Host header, attackers can make requests appear as if they are coming from a different domain, bypassing security measures.
2. Cache Poisoning: Attackers can inject malicious content into caches or proxy servers, which can then be served to unsuspecting users.
3. Session Hijacking: Injecting a malicious Host header can lead to session hijacking, allowing attackers to take control of user sessions.
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Host header injection can be combined with other techniques to launch XSS attacks, potentially compromising user data or performing malicious actions.

Risks:
The risks associated with host header injection include:
1. Unauthorized Access: Attackers can trick the server into processing requests as if they were intended for a different domain, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
2. Data Leakage: Host header injection can result in the exposure of sensitive information, including session cookies or other user data.
3. Session Hijacking: Attackers can hijack user sessions by injecting a malicious Host header, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
4. Cache Poisoning: Injecting malicious content into caches or proxy servers can lead to the distribution of harmful content to other users.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
To mitigate the risks associated with host header injection, consider implementing the following measures:
1. Validate Host Header: Ensure that the Host header is properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
2. Use Whitelisting: Implement a whitelist of allowed hosts or domains to restrict the valid values of the Host header.
3. Normalize Host Values: Normalize the Host header values to prevent variations that could be used for injection attacks.
4. Use Server-Side Configuration: Configure the server to only respond to requests with valid and expected Host headers.
5. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Implement HSTS to enforce the use of HTTPS and prevent downgrade attacks.
6. Security Testing: Perform regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and address host header injection vulnerabilities.
7. Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy that restricts the sources of content that can be loaded, reducing the impact of host header injection.
8. Secure Development Practices: Educate developers about secure coding practices, including proper validation and sanitization of input, including the Host header.

OWASP Top 10 Category:
Host header injection does not have a specific category in the OWASP Top 10 list. However, it falls under the broader category of "Injection" vulnerabilities, which is covered in the OWASP Top 10. Host header injection is a specific type of injection vulnerability that affects the Host header of HTTP requests.
