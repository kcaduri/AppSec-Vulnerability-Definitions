Vulnerability Description:
The "Missing HTTPOnly Attribute in Session Cookie" vulnerability occurs when a web application sets a session cookie without the HTTPOnly attribute. The HTTPOnly attribute is an important security feature that prevents client-side scripts, such as JavaScript, from accessing the cookie. Without this attribute, the session cookie becomes vulnerable to certain client-side attacks.

Threats:
1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks: If an attacker successfully injects malicious scripts into the web application via XSS, they can access the session cookie without the HTTPOnly attribute and steal sensitive session information.
2. Session Hijacking: By obtaining the session cookie, attackers can impersonate a legitimate user, leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to the user's account.

Attack Techniques:
The primary attack technique for exploiting the "Missing HTTPOnly Attribute in Session Cookie" vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). If attackers find an XSS vulnerability in the application, they can execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, and these scripts can read the session cookie due to the absence of the HTTPOnly attribute.

Risks:
The risks associated with the missing HTTPOnly attribute in the session cookie include:
1. Session Hijacking: Attackers can steal session cookies and hijack legitimate user sessions, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
2. Sensitive Data Exposure: If the session cookie contains sensitive information, such as user IDs or personally identifiable information (PII), it becomes accessible to attackers through XSS.
3. Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify the session cookie content, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
To mitigate the "Missing HTTPOnly Attribute in Session Cookie" vulnerability, consider the following measures:
1. Set HTTPOnly Attribute: Ensure that the session cookie is set with the HTTPOnly attribute, preventing client-side scripts from accessing it.
2. Secure Coding and Input Validation: Implement secure coding practices and input validation mechanisms to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in the application.
3. Enable Secure Flag: Consider setting the Secure flag on the session cookie if the application uses HTTPS to ensure the cookie is only sent over secure encrypted connections.
4. Regular Security Testing: Conduct regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and address XSS vulnerabilities.

OWASP Top 10 Category:
The "Missing HTTPOnly Attribute in Session Cookie" vulnerability falls under the "A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)" category in the OWASP Top 10. This category involves various XSS-related vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers, potentially compromising sensitive data and hijacking user sessions.
