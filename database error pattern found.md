Vulnerability Description:
The "Database Error Pattern found" vulnerability refers to the exposure of database errors or error messages in the context of a web application. These errors can occur when there are issues with database queries, connections, or data retrieval, and the error messages are unintentionally displayed to the users or attackers.

Threats:
1. Information Disclosure: Attackers can exploit the database error messages to gather sensitive information about the database schema, table names, column names, or even specific data values.
2. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities: Detailed error messages may provide valuable insights to attackers, helping them identify potential vulnerabilities and launch targeted attacks.

Risks:
1. Exposure of Sensitive Information: Database error messages may inadvertently expose sensitive information, such as database structure, query details, or internal system information.
2. Increased Attack Surface: Attackers can leverage the exposed error messages to devise more effective attacks, such as SQL injection or other database-related exploits.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
1. Custom Error Handling: Implement custom error handling mechanisms to intercept and handle database errors. Avoid displaying detailed error messages to users and provide generic error messages instead.
2. Secure Logging: Ensure that error logging mechanisms are in place to capture relevant information about database errors securely. These logs should be accessible only to authorized personnel.
3. Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement strict input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, which can lead to database errors.
4. Error Suppression: Configure the production environment to suppress detailed error messages and display generic error pages to users.
5. Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor and review error logs to identify any database-related errors and take appropriate actions to fix them.

OWASP Top 10 Category:
The "Database Error Pattern found" vulnerability does not fall into any specific category of the OWASP Top 10. However, it is essential to address this vulnerability as part of secure coding practices to prevent the exposure of sensitive database information and mitigate the risk of targeted attacks exploiting database-related vulnerabilities.
