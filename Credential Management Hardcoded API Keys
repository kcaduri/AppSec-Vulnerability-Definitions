Vulnerability Description:
The "Credential Management: Hardcoded API Keys" vulnerability occurs when API keys, which are used to authenticate and authorize API requests, are hardcoded directly into the application's source code. Hardcoding API keys exposes them to anyone who has access to the source code, including attackers who may reverse-engineer the application or inspect the code.

Threats:
1. Unauthorized Access: Attackers can extract hardcoded API keys from the source code to gain unauthorized access to APIs and services, potentially leading to data breaches or misuse of services.
2. Service Abuse: Malicious actors can use stolen API keys to perform unauthorized actions, consume resources, or exploit services, leading to financial and operational impacts.
3. Privilege Escalation: Hardcoded API keys with high privileges can be used by attackers to escalate privileges and gain deeper access to the system or network.
4. Reputation Damage: Unauthorized use of API keys can lead to misuse of services, resulting in potential reputational damage and loss of trust among users and stakeholders.

Exploitation:
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by reverse-engineering the application, inspecting the source code, or extracting API keys from compiled binaries. Once the API keys are obtained, attackers can use them to make unauthorized API requests, perform malicious actions, or access sensitive data.

Risks:
1. Data Breach: Exposure of hardcoded API keys can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, resulting in data breaches and regulatory non-compliance.
2. Financial Loss: Unauthorized use of API keys can lead to increased operational costs, resource consumption, and potential financial loss due to abuse of services.
3. Service Disruption: Malicious use of API keys can lead to service disruptions, denial of service, or degradation of service quality.
4. Compliance Violations: Hardcoded API keys may lead to non-compliance with industry regulations and security standards, resulting in legal and financial penalties.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
1. Environment Variables: Store API keys in environment variables or secure configuration management systems, rather than hardcoding them into the source code.
2. Secrets Management: Use dedicated secrets management solutions, such as AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault, to securely store and manage API keys and other sensitive credentials.
3. Access Controls: Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized users and services can access and use API keys.
4. Rotate API Keys: Regularly rotate API keys to minimize the risk of exposure and misuse. Implement automated mechanisms for key rotation and invalidation.
5. Monitor and Audit: Continuously monitor and audit the usage of API keys to detect and respond to unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
6. Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews and static analysis to identify and remediate instances of hardcoded API keys in the source code.

OWASP Top 10 Category:
This vulnerability falls under the "A2: Broken Authentication" and "A3: Sensitive Data Exposure" categories of the OWASP Top 10. These categories emphasize the importance of secure authentication mechanisms and the protection of sensitive data, including API keys, to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
