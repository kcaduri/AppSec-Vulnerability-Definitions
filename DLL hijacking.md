Vulnerability Description:
DLL Hijacking, also known as "DLL Side-Loading," is a type of vulnerability that occurs when an attacker exploits the way Windows searches for dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to load into an application. If an application does not specify the full path to the DLL it needs, an attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name in a directory searched by Windows, leading to the execution of the attacker's code instead of the legitimate DLL.

Threats:
1. Code Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the vulnerable application, potentially gaining control over the affected system.
2. Malware Injection: Malicious DLLs can be used to inject malware or backdoors into legitimate applications.
3. Privilege Escalation: If a vulnerable application runs with elevated privileges, attackers can exploit DLL hijacking to escalate their own privileges.

Attack Techniques:
Attackers can exploit DLL Hijacking by placing a malicious DLL in a directory where the vulnerable application searches for DLLs. When the application is launched and attempts to load the DLL, it inadvertently loads the malicious one instead.

Risks:
The risks associated with DLL Hijacking include:
1. Unauthorized Code Execution: Attackers can execute code within the context of a legitimate application, potentially compromising system integrity and data confidentiality.
2. System Compromise: Successful DLL Hijacking can lead to a compromised system, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, install malware, or gain control.
3. Privilege Escalation: If an application with elevated privileges is vulnerable, attackers can use DLL Hijacking to escalate their privileges.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
To mitigate DLL Hijacking vulnerabilities, consider the following measures:
1. Full Path Specification: Ensure that applications use full paths when loading DLLs, avoiding reliance on the system's search paths.
2. Use Safe Functions: Use safe DLL-loading functions, such as "LoadLibraryEx," that provide options to load DLLs securely.
3. Code Signing: Digitally sign DLLs and applications to verify their authenticity and integrity.
4. Apply Whitelisting: Implement application whitelisting to control which DLLs are allowed to be loaded by the application.
5. Regular Updates: Keep all software, including applications and the operating system, up to date with the latest security patches.

OWASP Top 10 Category:
The "DLL Hijacking" vulnerability aligns with the broader category of "A5: Broken Access Control" in the OWASP Top 10. It involves exploiting the improper loading of DLLs, which can lead to unauthorized code execution and system compromise, both of which are related to access control vulnerabilities.
