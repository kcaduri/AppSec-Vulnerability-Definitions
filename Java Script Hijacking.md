Vulnerability Description:
JavaScript Hijacking, also known as "JavaScript Injection" or "Script Injection," is a web application vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users. This can happen when the application does not properly validate or sanitize user input that is displayed on web pages, allowing the injection of untrusted scripts.

Threats:
1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): JavaScript Hijacking is a type of Cross-Site Scripting attack, where the injected script executes in the victim's browser in the context of the vulnerable web application, potentially compromising user data and session information.
2. Credential Theft: Attackers can use JavaScript Hijacking to steal user credentials, session tokens, or other sensitive information entered on the compromised web page.
3. Session Hijacking: JavaScript Hijacking can enable session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate users and perform actions on their behalf.

Attack Techniques:
JavaScript Hijacking is typically exploited through various injection techniques, including:
1. Stored XSS: Attacker injects malicious scripts into a vulnerable application's database, and the script is later rendered when the compromised data is displayed to other users.
2. Reflected XSS: Attacker tricks a user into clicking on a crafted link that includes the malicious script, and the script is reflected back in the server's response.
3. DOM-based XSS: The attack is executed entirely on the client-side, manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to execute the injected script.

Risks:
The risks associated with JavaScript Hijacking include:
1. Data Theft: Attackers can steal sensitive data, such as login credentials, personal information, or payment details, from users visiting the compromised page.
2. Unauthorized Actions: JavaScript Hijacking can lead to unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim, such as changing settings or initiating fraudulent transactions.
3. Compromised Trust: Users may lose trust in the application if it is perceived as insecure, leading to reputational damage for the organization.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
To mitigate JavaScript Hijacking, consider the following measures:
1. Input Validation and Sanitization: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent script injection and other types of XSS attacks.
2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be executed on the web pages, preventing unauthorized scripts from running.
3. Escape Output: Ensure that data displayed on web pages is properly escaped to prevent script execution.
4. Security Testing: Regularly perform security testing, including code reviews, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing, to identify and address vulnerabilities.

OWASP Top 10 Category:
JavaScript Hijacking is a type of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, which is categorized under "A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)" in the OWASP Top 10. XSS involves vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of a vulnerable web application, potentially compromising user data and web application integrity.
