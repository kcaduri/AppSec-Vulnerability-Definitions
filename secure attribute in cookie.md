To fix the missing "Secure" attribute in cookies on an IIS server, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.

2. In the left-hand pane of the IIS Manager, expand the server name and then expand the "Sites" folder.

3. Locate the website for which you want to fix the missing "Secure" attribute in cookies and select it.

4. In the main window, double-click on the "HTTP Response Headers" icon.

5. In the HTTP Response Headers window, locate the "Set-Cookie" header.

6. If the "Set-Cookie" header does not exist, you can add it by clicking on the "Add..." button on the right-hand side.

   a. In the "Name" field, enter "Set-Cookie" (without quotes).
   b. In the "Value" field, enter the name of the cookie you want to modify. For example, if the cookie name is "MyCookie", enter "MyCookie" (without quotes).
   c. In the "Set common headers" section, check the "Enable HTTP keep-alive" option.
   d. Click "OK" to add the "Set-Cookie" header.

7. If the "Set-Cookie" header already exists, you can modify it by selecting it and clicking on the "Edit..." button on the right-hand side.

8. In the Edit Custom HTTP Response Header dialog, append "; secure" (without quotes) to the existing value in the "Value" field. For example, if the existing value is "MyCookie=Value", change it to "MyCookie=Value; secure".

9. Click "OK" to save the changes.

10. Click on the "Apply" button at the top-right corner to save the changes.

After following these steps, the "Secure" attribute will be added or updated in the "Set-Cookie" header for the specified website on your IIS server. Repeat the process for any additional websites or cookies if needed.

Note: The "Secure" attribute ensures that cookies are only sent over secure (HTTPS) connections. Make sure your website is configured to use HTTPS and has a valid SSL certificate before enabling the "Secure" attribute in cookies.
