Client-side template injection (CSTI) is a vulnerability that occurs when user-supplied input is embedded directly into a template, which is then processed and rendered by the client-side. This vulnerability typically affects applications that use client-side rendering frameworks or template engines.

Vulnerability Description:
When an application doesn't properly validate or sanitize user input before including it in the template, it opens the door for CSTI attacks. Attackers can inject malicious template syntax into user-provided input, leading to the execution of arbitrary code or the disclosure of sensitive information.

Threats:
1. Code Execution: Attackers can inject malicious code that gets executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially compromising their session, stealing sensitive information, or performing actions on their behalf.
2. Information Disclosure: By injecting template syntax, attackers can access and retrieve sensitive information from the application or other users' data.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): CSTI can be used to inject and execute JavaScript code, leading to cross-site scripting attacks.

Attack Techniques:
1. Injection of template-specific syntax: Attackers may inject template directives, tags, or expressions that the rendering engine interprets and executes.
2. Manipulating existing template variables: If the application allows user-controlled input to modify existing template variables, an attacker can inject malicious content to influence the rendered output.

Risks:
The risks associated with CSTI vulnerabilities include:
1. Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
2. Execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser.
3. Account hijacking or session compromise.
4. Information leakage and data exfiltration.
5. Impact on application availability or integrity.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
To mitigate CSTI vulnerabilities, consider the following measures:
1. Input Validation and Sanitization: Ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized before being included in a template.
2. Contextual Output Encoding: Apply output encoding techniques to prevent the interpretation of user input as code.
3. Template Engine Security Settings: Configure template engines to enforce stricter security settings, disable dangerous features, or restrict template access to trusted sources.
4. Developer Awareness and Training: Educate developers about secure coding practices, including the risks associated with CSTI vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.
5. Static Code Analysis and Penetration Testing: Perform regular security assessments to identify and address CSTI vulnerabilities in your application.

OWASP Top 10 Category:
Client-side template injection falls under the OWASP Top 10 category of "Injection," which encompasses various injection vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, command injection, and CSTI.
