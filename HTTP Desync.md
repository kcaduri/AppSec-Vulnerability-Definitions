Vulnerability Description:
HTTP Desync, also known as HTTP Request Smuggling, is a web security vulnerability that occurs when conflicting or ambiguous interpretations of HTTP messages are made by different components of a web server. This can lead to the manipulation of the HTTP request/response flow, potentially allowing attackers to perform various attacks.

Threats:

Cache Poisoning: Attackers may craft requests that, when interpreted differently by front-end and back-end servers, lead to cache poisoning.
Session Fixation: HTTP Desync could be used to manipulate session handling, leading to session fixation attacks.
Request Smuggling: By manipulating the interpretation of requests, attackers might be able to smuggle malicious requests past security controls.
How Attackers Exploit:

Header Interpretation Differences: Exploiting differences in how front-end and back-end servers interpret HTTP headers can allow attackers to send requests with conflicting or ambiguous information.
Backend Request Manipulation: Attackers aim to manipulate how the backend server processes the request by using inconsistencies in header parsing.
Risks:

Unauthorized Access: Successful HTTP Desync attacks could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions.
Session Compromise: Session-related attacks could compromise user sessions, leading to account hijacking.
Recommended Fixes and Controls:

Update Servers: Ensure that web servers and other components are updated to the latest versions, as vendors often release fixes for HTTP Desync vulnerabilities.
Firewall Configuration: Configure firewalls to block ambiguous or conflicting requests that could be indicative of HTTP Desync attacks.
Security Headers: Implement security headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), to mitigate the impact of potential HTTP Desync attacks.
Request Normalization: Implement request normalization mechanisms to ensure consistent interpretation of HTTP messages across server components.
OWASP Top 10 Category:
HTTP Desync doesn't fall under a specific OWASP Top 10 category, as the list primarily focuses on common web application vulnerabilities. However, the principles of secure input handling, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring the integrity of session management align with categories like A1 (Injection) and A2 (Broken Authentication).
