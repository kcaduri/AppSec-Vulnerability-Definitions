Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) header is an important security measure to protect your website from various types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection. A CSP header defines a set of rules that the browser should follow when loading resources on your web page. Here's how to implement a CSP header based on security best practices:

1. **Understand CSP Directives:**
   Familiarize yourself with CSP directives and their meanings. These directives specify which types of content are allowed and where they can be loaded from. Common directives include `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, `connect-src`, `font-src`, and `frame-src`.

2. **Start with a Default-Deny Policy:**
   It's a good practice to start with a default-deny policy and then gradually relax the restrictions as needed for your website to function properly. To do this, use a CSP header like the following:
   
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none';
   ```

   This directive tells the browser to disallow all content by default.

3. **Specify Allowed Sources:**
   Add specific directives to allow content to be loaded from trusted sources. For example, if you want to allow scripts from your own domain and from a CDN, you can use the following directive:

   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' cdn.example.com;
   ```

4. **Use the 'self' Keyword:**
   The `'self'` keyword is a powerful tool to allow content to be loaded from the same origin as your website. This helps prevent most types of XSS attacks.

5. **Utilize the 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' Keywords Sparingly:**
   Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` unless absolutely necessary for your website's functionality. These keywords can introduce security risks.

6. **Implement a Report-Only Header:**
   During the initial implementation and testing, it's a good idea to use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header instead of the regular `Content-Security-Policy`. This header will only report violations but won't enforce the policy. It allows you to fine-tune your policy without breaking your site for users.

   ```
   Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' cdn.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint;
   ```

7. **Test Your CSP:**
   Use browser developer tools and online CSP analysis tools to check for any CSP violations. These tools can help you identify and resolve issues with your policy.

8. **Update Your Policy as Needed:**
   As your website evolves, make sure to review and update your CSP policy to accommodate new features and resources.

9. **Consider Using a Nonce or Hashes:**
   For inline scripts or styles that you must include, consider using nonces or hashes to allow specific scripts/styles without enabling `'unsafe-inline'`. This provides a more secure way to include scripts/styles.

10. **Monitor CSP Reports:**
    Set up a system to monitor and analyze CSP violation reports sent by browsers. This will help you identify potential security issues and fine-tune your policy.

11. **Educate Your Development Team:**
    Ensure that your development team understands the importance of CSP and follows best practices when developing and deploying code.

12. **Regularly Review and Update:**
    Periodically review and update your CSP policy to adapt to changes in your website and security best practices.

Remember that a properly configured CSP can greatly enhance the security of your website, but it may require some trial and error to get it right. Always test thoroughly in different browsers and scenarios to ensure your CSP does not unintentionally block or break functionality on your site.

Here's an example of a Content Security Policy (CSP) header that follows best practices and includes the use of nonces where necessary:

```plaintext
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'nonce-randomlygeneratednonce123' cdn.example.com;
  style-src 'self' 'nonce-randomlygeneratednonce456' fonts.googleapis.com;
  img-src 'self' data: images.example.com;
  font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com;
  connect-src 'self' api.example.com;
  frame-src 'self' youtube.com;
  object-src 'none';
  media-src mediaserver.example.com;
  frame-ancestors 'none';
  upgrade-insecure-requests;
  block-all-mixed-content;
```

Here's an explanation of the directives used in this example:

1. `default-src 'self';`: This sets a default policy of allowing resources to be loaded only from the same origin as the website.

2. `script-src 'self' 'nonce-randomlygeneratednonce123' cdn.example.com;`: This allows scripts to be loaded from the same origin (`'self'`), a specific CDN (`cdn.example.com`), and includes the use of a nonce (`'nonce-randomlygeneratednonce123'`) to allow inline scripts with this nonce.

3. `style-src 'self' 'nonce-randomlygeneratednonce456' fonts.googleapis.com;`: This permits stylesheets from the same origin, styles with a specific nonce (`'nonce-randomlygeneratednonce456'`), and styles from Google Fonts.

4. `img-src 'self' data: images.example.com;`: This allows images to be loaded from the same origin, data URIs, and a specific domain (`images.example.com`).

5. `font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com;`: This directive permits fonts to be loaded from the same origin and from Google Fonts (`fonts.gstatic.com`).

6. `connect-src 'self' api.example.com;`: This allows connections to the same origin and to `api.example.com`.

7. `frame-src 'self' youtube.com;`: This directive permits frames to be loaded from the same origin and from YouTube (`youtube.com`).

8. `object-src 'none';`: This disallows any plugins or objects to be loaded.

9. `media-src mediaserver.example.com;`: This allows media resources to be loaded from `mediaserver.example.com`.

10. `frame-ancestors 'none';`: This disallows embedding the website in frames on other domains.

11. `upgrade-insecure-requests;`: This instructs the browser to upgrade HTTP requests to HTTPS where possible.

12. `block-all-mixed-content;`: This prevents mixed content issues by blocking HTTP resources on an HTTPS page.

Please note that the `'nonce-randomlygeneratednonce123'` and `'nonce-randomlygeneratednonce456'` values should be replaced with actual random nonce values generated for each inline script and style you want to allow. The use of nonces ensures that only scripts and styles with matching nonces will be executed, enhancing security against injection attacks.

Make sure to adapt this policy to the specific needs and resources of your website, and thoroughly test it to ensure it doesn't block any necessary functionality. Additionally, regularly review and update your CSP policy as your website evolves and security requirements change.

Implementing nonces in your Content Security Policy (CSP) involves generating random tokens and including them in the appropriate CSP directives for inline scripts and styles. Nonces are used to allow specific inline scripts and styles to execute, enhancing security by ensuring that only scripts/styles with matching nonces are allowed. Here's how to implement nonces:

1. **Generate Nonces:**
   You need to generate a unique nonce value for each inline script and style that you want to include in your web page. Nonces are typically random strings. You can generate nonces in your server-side code or using a server-side template engine if your application uses one.

   Here's an example of generating nonces in PHP:

   ```php
   $nonce_script = bin2hex(random_bytes(16)); // Generates a 32-character nonce
   $nonce_style = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));
   ```

2. **Include Nonces in CSP Directives:**
   Insert the nonce values into the appropriate CSP directives using the `'nonce-'` keyword. For example, if you have an inline script and style that you want to allow, you would include the nonces like this:

   ```html
   <script nonce="<?php echo $nonce_script; ?>">
       // Your inline script here
   </script>
   
   <style nonce="<?php echo $nonce_style; ?>">
       /* Your inline style here */
   </style>
   ```

   In this example, `<?php echo $nonce_script; ?>` and `<?php echo $nonce_style; ?>` should be replaced with the actual nonce values generated in step 1.

3. **Update CSP Header:**
   In your HTTP response headers, include the CSP directives with the `'nonce-'` keyword for scripts and styles. Here's an example CSP header with the nonces included:

   ```plaintext
   Content-Security-Policy:
     default-src 'self';
     script-src 'self' 'nonce-<?php echo $nonce_script; ?>' cdn.example.com;
     style-src 'self' 'nonce-<?php echo $nonce_style; ?>' fonts.googleapis.com;
     /* ... other directives ... */
   ```

   Ensure that the nonce values in the CSP header match the ones you generated for the specific inline scripts and styles on your page.

4. **Test and Validate:**
   After implementing nonces, thoroughly test your web page to ensure that the CSP policy works as expected. Use browser developer tools to check for any CSP violation reports and make adjustments as needed.

5. **Review and Update Nonces:**
   Nonces should be unique for each page load. Regenerate and update nonces for each request to maintain security. Server-side logic should handle this generation.

By implementing nonces, you can allow specific inline scripts and styles while maintaining a strong CSP policy that helps protect your website against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Remember to keep your nonces random and unique for each page load to enhance security.
