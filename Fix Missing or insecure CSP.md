Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) header is an important security measure to protect your website from various types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection. A CSP header defines a set of rules that the browser should follow when loading resources on your web page. Here's how to implement a CSP header based on security best practices:

1. **Understand CSP Directives:**
   Familiarize yourself with CSP directives and their meanings. These directives specify which types of content are allowed and where they can be loaded from. Common directives include `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, `connect-src`, `font-src`, and `frame-src`.

2. **Start with a Default-Deny Policy:**
   It's a good practice to start with a default-deny policy and then gradually relax the restrictions as needed for your website to function properly. To do this, use a CSP header like the following:
   
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none';
   ```

   This directive tells the browser to disallow all content by default.

3. **Specify Allowed Sources:**
   Add specific directives to allow content to be loaded from trusted sources. For example, if you want to allow scripts from your own domain and from a CDN, you can use the following directive:

   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' cdn.example.com;
   ```

4. **Use the 'self' Keyword:**
   The `'self'` keyword is a powerful tool to allow content to be loaded from the same origin as your website. This helps prevent most types of XSS attacks.

5. **Utilize the 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' Keywords Sparingly:**
   Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` unless absolutely necessary for your website's functionality. These keywords can introduce security risks.

6. **Implement a Report-Only Header:**
   During the initial implementation and testing, it's a good idea to use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header instead of the regular `Content-Security-Policy`. This header will only report violations but won't enforce the policy. It allows you to fine-tune your policy without breaking your site for users.

   ```
   Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' cdn.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint;
   ```

7. **Test Your CSP:**
   Use browser developer tools and online CSP analysis tools to check for any CSP violations. These tools can help you identify and resolve issues with your policy.

8. **Update Your Policy as Needed:**
   As your website evolves, make sure to review and update your CSP policy to accommodate new features and resources.

9. **Consider Using a Nonce or Hashes:**
   For inline scripts or styles that you must include, consider using nonces or hashes to allow specific scripts/styles without enabling `'unsafe-inline'`. This provides a more secure way to include scripts/styles.

10. **Monitor CSP Reports:**
    Set up a system to monitor and analyze CSP violation reports sent by browsers. This will help you identify potential security issues and fine-tune your policy.

11. **Educate Your Development Team:**
    Ensure that your development team understands the importance of CSP and follows best practices when developing and deploying code.

12. **Regularly Review and Update:**
    Periodically review and update your CSP policy to adapt to changes in your website and security best practices.

Remember that a properly configured CSP can greatly enhance the security of your website, but it may require some trial and error to get it right. Always test thoroughly in different browsers and scenarios to ensure your CSP does not unintentionally block or break functionality on your site.
