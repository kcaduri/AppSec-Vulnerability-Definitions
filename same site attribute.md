To implement the missing "SameSite" attribute on an IIS web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.

2. In the left-hand pane of the IIS Manager, expand the server name and then expand the "Sites" folder.

3. Locate the website for which you want to implement the missing "SameSite" attribute and select it.

4. In the main window, double-click on the "HTTP Response Headers" icon.

5. In the HTTP Response Headers window, locate the "Set-Cookie" header.

6. If the "Set-Cookie" header does not exist, you can add it by clicking on the "Add..." button on the right-hand side.

   a. In the "Name" field, enter "Set-Cookie" (without quotes).
   b. In the "Value" field, enter the name of the cookie you want to modify. For example, if the cookie name is "MyCookie", enter "MyCookie" (without quotes).
   c. In the "Set common headers" section, check the "Enable HTTP keep-alive" option.
   d. Click "OK" to add the "Set-Cookie" header.

7. If the "Set-Cookie" header already exists, you can modify it by selecting it and clicking on the "Edit..." button on the right-hand side.

8. In the Edit Custom HTTP Response Header dialog, append "; SameSite=Strict" or "; SameSite=Lax" (without quotes) to the existing value in the "Value" field. For example, if the existing value is "MyCookie=Value", change it to "MyCookie=Value; SameSite=Strict" or "MyCookie=Value; SameSite=Lax" depending on your desired level of SameSite enforcement.

   - Use "SameSite=Strict" to enforce strict SameSite behavior, allowing the cookie to be sent only in first-party contexts.
   - Use "SameSite=Lax" to enforce lax SameSite behavior, allowing the cookie to be sent in cross-origin POST requests, such as those originating from a link click.

9. Click "OK" to save the changes.

10. Click on the "Apply" button at the top-right corner to save the changes.

After following these steps, the "SameSite" attribute will be added or updated in the "Set-Cookie" header for the specified website on your IIS server. Repeat the process for any additional websites or cookies if needed.

Note: The "SameSite" attribute helps protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Ensure that you understand the implications of setting the "SameSite" attribute to "Strict" or "Lax" for your specific application and test your website thoroughly after implementing it.
