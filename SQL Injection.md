Vulnerability Description:

SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the SQL query and perform unauthorized actions on the database, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying or deleting data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the underlying server.


Threats:

1. Data Theft: Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information.

2. Data Manipulation: SQL injection allows attackers to modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes to the application's records.

3. Application Takeover: In severe cases, attackers can leverage SQL injection to gain administrative privileges or execute arbitrary code on the server, taking full control of the application.


Attack Techniques:

Attackers can exploit SQL injection through various techniques, including:

1. Union-Based SQL Injection: Injecting malicious SQL code that retrieves data from other tables using the UNION operator.

2. Blind SQL Injection: Exploiting the vulnerability without getting direct responses from the application, making it more challenging to identify the vulnerability.

3. Time-Based Blind SQL Injection: Injecting SQL queries that cause delays to infer whether a condition is true or false.

4. Error-Based SQL Injection: Exploiting SQL errors to infer the structure of the database or gather information about the application.


Risks:

The risks associated with SQL injection are severe and can lead to:

1. Data Breach: Sensitive data, such as user credentials or customer information, can be stolen and exposed to unauthorized parties.

2. Data Loss or Corruption: Attackers can manipulate or delete data, causing data loss or corruption within the database.

3. Unauthorized Access: Attackers may gain unauthorized access to parts of the application or administrative functions.


Recommended Fixes and Controls:

To mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities, consider the following measures:

1. Use Parameterized Queries: Utilize prepared statements or parameterized queries in your code to separate user-supplied input from SQL commands.

2. Sanitize User Input: Validate and sanitize user input to ensure that it adheres to the expected format and does not contain malicious characters or SQL code.

3. Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that database users and application accounts have the least privilege required to perform their tasks.

4. Input Validation: Validate and enforce strict input validation to prevent illegal or malformed inputs from reaching the database.

5. Web Application Firewall (WAF): Implement a WAF to help detect and block SQL injection attempts before they reach the application.


OWASP Top 10 Category:

SQL injection falls under the "A1: Injection" category in the OWASP Top 10. This category includes various injection vulnerabilities, with SQL injection being one of the most prevalent and dangerous among them.
