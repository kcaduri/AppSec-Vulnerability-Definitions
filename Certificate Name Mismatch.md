The finding "Certificate Name Mismatch" with a description of "There is a discrepancy where hostname does not match the SAN on the certificate (SSL Common Name Mismatch Error) which indicates misconfiguration" indicates a misconfiguration in the SSL/TLS certificate used for your website. Let's break down the details:

**Vulnerability Description**:
- "Certificate Name Mismatch" refers to a situation where the hostname (the domain or URL used to access a website) doesn't match the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or Common Name (CN) listed in the SSL/TLS certificate for that site.

**Threats**:
- The primary threat is the potential for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. If the certificate name doesn't match the hostname, it could allow attackers to impersonate your website and intercept sensitive data transmitted between users and your site.
- It can also undermine user trust. Users may be wary of accessing a site with a certificate name mismatch, potentially leading to loss of traffic.

**How Attackers Exploit**:
- Attackers could exploit this by setting up a server with a certificate that doesn't match the hostname they want to impersonate. If clients (web browsers, applications) don't properly validate certificates, they might establish connections without realizing that they're connecting to an attacker's server.

**Risks**:
- Risks include data interception and potential reputational damage to your website. Users may be concerned about the security of their data when accessing a site with a certificate name mismatch.

**Recommended Fixes and Controls**:
1. **Correct Certificate**: Ensure that the SSL/TLS certificate installed on your web server correctly matches the hostname or domain used to access the site.
2. **Proper Certificate Configuration**: When obtaining or renewing SSL/TLS certificates, make sure the Common Name (CN) and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields are configured to match the hostname.
3. **Certificate Validation**: Implement strict certificate validation in your web server or application to verify that the presented certificate matches the requested hostname.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Periodically monitor your certificates for expiration and correctness, and renew them in a timely manner.

**OWASP Top 10 Category**: This issue is not explicitly listed in the OWASP Top 10, but it falls under the broader category of "Security Misconfiguration" (A5), as it represents a misconfiguration of SSL/TLS certificates, which is an important aspect of web application security.
