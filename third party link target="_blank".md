Vulnerability Description:
The "Third-Party Link target='_blank' in HTML" vulnerability occurs when a web application uses the "target='_blank'" attribute in HTML anchor tags to open external links in a new browser tab without the "rel='noopener' or 'noreferrer'" attribute. This can lead to a security risk known as "Tabnabbing."

Threats:
1. Tabnabbing: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to perform tabnabbing, where a new browser tab is opened with a trusted website, and the original tab is redirected to a malicious website without the user's knowledge. This can trick users into entering their credentials or sensitive information on the malicious site.
2. Phishing Attacks: By redirecting the original tab to a phishing page, attackers can trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal data.
3. Clickjacking: Attackers can use the "target='_blank'" attribute to overlay transparent elements on top of the link, enticing users to click on malicious content hidden underneath.

Attack Techniques:
The primary attack technique for exploiting this vulnerability is tabnabbing. When a user clicks on a link with the "target='_blank'" attribute, the new tab opens with the attacker's malicious page, while the original tab's content is replaced with the attacker's content, making it look like the trusted website.

Risks:
The risks associated with the "Third-Party Link target='_blank' in HTML" vulnerability include:
1. Phishing: Users may unknowingly enter their sensitive information on malicious websites, leading to identity theft or financial loss.
2. Unauthorized Access: If the user is already authenticated to a trusted website in the original tab, the attacker can potentially access the user's account on that site.
3. Malware Delivery: Attackers can use the redirected tab to deliver malware to the user's device.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
To mitigate the "Third-Party Link target='_blank' in HTML" vulnerability, consider the following measures:
1. Add 'rel' Attribute: Always include the "rel='noopener'" or "rel='noreferrer'" attribute in anchor tags with "target='_blank'." This prevents the new tab from having access to the referring tab's window object, thwarting tabnabbing attacks.
2. Avoid Blank Targets: Whenever possible, avoid using "target='_blank'" altogether, as it can create usability and security issues for users.
3. Educate Users: Educate users about the risks of clicking on links in new tabs without proper verification.
