Vulnerability Description:

LDAP injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an LDAP query. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the LDAP query and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions within the LDAP directory.


Threats:

1. Unauthorized Access: Attackers can use LDAP injection to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources or user accounts in the LDAP directory.

2. Data Leakage: LDAP injection can lead to the exposure of sensitive information stored in the LDAP directory, such as user credentials or personally identifiable information (PII).

3. Data Manipulation: Attackers may modify or delete data within the LDAP directory, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes to directory entries.


Attack Techniques:

Attackers can exploit LDAP injection through various techniques, including:

1. Malicious Input: Injecting LDAP metacharacters or escape sequences into user input to modify the structure of the LDAP query.

2. Blind LDAP Injection: Exploiting the vulnerability without receiving direct responses from the application, making it more challenging to detect the attack.

3. Time-Based Blind LDAP Injection: Injecting LDAP queries that cause delays to infer whether a condition is true or false.


Risks:

The risks associated with LDAP injection are significant and can lead to:

1. Data Breach: Sensitive data, such as user credentials, can be stolen and used to access other systems or applications if users reuse passwords.

2. Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data in the LDAP directory, leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes to directory entries.

3. Unauthorized Access: Attackers may gain unauthorized access to parts of the application or sensitive resources protected by LDAP authentication.


Recommended Fixes and Controls:

To mitigate LDAP injection vulnerabilities, consider the following measures:

1. Use Parameterized Queries: Utilize parameterized LDAP queries or prepared statements in your code to separate user-supplied input from LDAP commands.

2. Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input to ensure that it adheres to the expected format and does not contain LDAP metacharacters or escape sequences.

3. Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that LDAP accounts have the least privilege required to perform their tasks and limit access to sensitive directory entries.

4. LDAP Filters: Use proper LDAP filters to restrict search results and ensure that only necessary data is returned in LDAP queries.

5. Escaping Special Characters: If dynamic filter construction is required, properly escape LDAP metacharacters to prevent injection attacks.


OWASP Top 10 Category:

LDAP injection falls under the "A1: Injection" category in the OWASP Top 10. This category includes various injection vulnerabilities, with LDAP injection being a specific subset related to LDAP queries.
