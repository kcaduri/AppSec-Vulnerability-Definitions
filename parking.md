We have based the SAST and DAST requirements for Lynx based on the changes listed as of BRD indicating implementation scope will include changes to the application code, webfront, DB tables and data transfer jobs. Looking at the release plan (RLSE0728991) this seems to align with the expectation that there are web and backend core packages planned to be installed.

Although the updates might be minor, by standard and for completeness it is required to be tested before prod release. I would highly recommend running the test again even if itâ€™s the same code base (+fix packages), as since the last time the code or front end was tested the scan policies and types of threats have drastically updated.

We have reviewed the SAST and DAST requirements for Lynx based on the changes mentioned in the Business Requirements Document (BRD). It appears that the implementation scope will involve modifications to the application code, webfront, DB tables, and data transfer jobs. When we refer to the release plan (RLSE0728991), it seems that there are plans to install web and backend core packages.

Although the updates may be minor, it is important for us to follow standard procedures and ensure thorough testing before the production release. I strongly recommend running the tests again, even if we are working with the same code base with fixed packages. The reason for this is that since the last testing phase, there have been significant updates in scan policies and the types of threats that need to be considered.

By retesting, we can ensure that our application remains secure against the latest vulnerabilities and attacks. This proactive approach will help us maintain a robust and reliable system.
