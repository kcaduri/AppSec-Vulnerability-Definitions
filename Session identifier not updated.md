Vulnerability Description:
The "Session identifier not updated" vulnerability refers to a situation where a web application fails to update the session identifier after a user authenticates or performs certain actions. This can occur when the session identifier remains unchanged throughout the entire session, making it susceptible to attacks.

Threats:
The lack of updating the session identifier poses several threats:

1. Session Hijacking: Attackers can intercept and capture the session identifier, allowing them to impersonate the authenticated user and gain unauthorized access to their account.
2. Session Fixation: Attackers can force a specific session identifier on the user, enabling them to later assume control of the session and perform unauthorized actions.
3. Session Replay: Attackers can record and replay a captured session identifier, allowing them to bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access.
4. Privilege Escalation: If a user's privileges or access levels are stored in the session identifier, failing to update it can enable an attacker to elevate their privileges within the application.

Attacker Exploitation:
Attackers can exploit the session identifier not being updated in the following ways:

1. Session Hijacking: By intercepting and capturing the session identifier through techniques like sniffing network traffic or exploiting insecure session management, attackers can impersonate the authenticated user.
2. Session Fixation: Attackers can force a known or predetermined session identifier on a user, tricking them into authenticating with a session under the attacker's control.
3. Session Replay: Attackers can record a captured session identifier and later replay it to gain unauthorized access to the application without the need for valid credentials.
4. Privilege Escalation: If the session identifier contains information about the user's privileges or access levels, attackers can manipulate or inject a session identifier with higher privileges to escalate their privileges within the application.

Risks:
The risks associated with not updating the session identifier include:

1. Unauthorized Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and perform actions on their behalf, potentially leading to data breaches, information disclosure, or fraud.
2. Identity Theft: Attackers can impersonate legitimate users by hijacking their sessions, which can result in identity theft and misuse of sensitive information.
3. Privilege Escalation: Failing to update the session identifier may allow attackers to escalate their privileges within the application, gaining access to sensitive functionality or data.
4. Session Manipulation: Attackers can manipulate sessions, replay captured sessions, or force session identifiers, leading to unauthorized actions or tampering with user data.

Recommended Fixes and Controls:
To mitigate the risks associated with session identifiers not being updated, consider implementing the following measures:

1. Session Regeneration: Generate a new session identifier after a user successfully authenticates or performs sensitive actions. This ensures that the identifier changes throughout the session.
2. Secure Session Management: Implement secure session management practices, including properly generating and handling session identifiers, enforcing session timeouts, and securely storing session data.
3. Session Expiration: Set appropriate session expiration times to limit the duration of a session and automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.
4. Session Revocation: Provide the ability to revoke or invalidate sessions when a user logs out or if suspicious activity is detected.
5. Transport Layer Security (TLS): Use HTTPS with a secure configuration to protect session identifiers in transit and prevent eavesdropping or tampering.
6. Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent session-related attacks, such as injection or manipulation of session identifiers.

OWASP Top 10 Category:
The "Session identifier not updated" vulnerability falls under the "Broken Authentication" category in the OWASP Top 10 list.
